# Customized-Collection-Framework-of-Data-Structures

This repository contains a comprehensive collection of data structures and algorithms implemented in C++. It covers singly and doubly linked lists, circular linked lists, stacks, queues, binary search trees, and various sorting and searching algorithms. The code is written with templates for reusability and generic programming.
